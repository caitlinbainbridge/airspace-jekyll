            <h2>About Me</h2>
          </div>
          <p>My name is Caitlin Bainbridge, I am 22 years old and am from Rockford, Michigan. I recently graduated from Grand Valley State University, and I received a Bachelorâ€™s Degree of Science focusing in Clinical Exercise Science. I believe in promoting health, fitness, and wellness to individuals, provide a more preventative approach when it comes to injuries and chronic diseases. I recently finished an internship with Northern Physical Therapy as a Wellness Marketing Intern. During my time at Northern I was able to instruct various fitness classes that they offered, and realized how much I enjoy wellness marketing and corporate wellness. The field of exercise science has endless opportunities for growth, and I am eager start my career!</p>
          <p>A little background about me, I grew up in a family who ate a lot during family gatherings and multiple family members were overweight and had some form of chronic disease or health issues. I have always struggled with my weight and I knew I did not want to follow the same path as most of my family. I went to college thinking I want to get into the health field in some way or another and found out I could do an undergrad in exercise science. Now at the time I was not entirely sure what this degree entailed, but knew it would get me into physical therapy school. It was the best decision I could have ever made for myself. As someone who loves to learn about the human body this degree whole fundamental purpose is preventative approaches to chronic diseases. I learned all that I could about how exercise and having a healthy diet can benefit me not only now but my future lifestyle. Even though my ultimate goal is becoming a physical therapist one day I want to promote health, fitness, and wellness lifestyles to my community and not only change my families outcomes of preventable diseases but others as well. Fun facts about me: I enjoy hiking, reading, lifting weights, running, being outdoors, and spending time with family and friends. My ultimate goal in life is becoming a physical therapist, that offers health, fitness, and wellness services to the community.</p>
